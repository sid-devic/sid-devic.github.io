      <h2 id="about">About</h2>

<p>I’m Sid, a CS PhD student in the 
<a href="https://viterbi-web.usc.edu/~cstheory/" target="_blank">USC Theory Group</a>, where I am fortunate to be advised by the wonderful <a href="https://vatsalsharan.github.io/" target="_blank">Vatsal Sharan</a> and <a href="https://www.korolova.com/" target="_blank">Aleksandra Korolova</a>.
I am broadly interested in trustworthy, fair, and robust machine learning and AI. 
I am grateful to have my research supported by a National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (<a href="https://ndseg.sysplus.com/NDSEG/about/" target="_blank">NDSEG</a>, 2021-2024) Fellowship and a <a href="https://viterbigrad.usc.edu/tuition-and-funding/doctoral-funding-2/" target="_blank">USC Viterbi Graduate Fellowship</a> (2024-2025).
<a href="./assets/files/cv_public_siddartha_devic.pdf" target="_blank">Here</a> is my CV <i>(Sep. 2025)</i>.</p>
        
  <p>I have been lucky to spend some time doing fun research at various places outside of USC during my PhD.
    <ul>
      <li>
        Summer 2025: Research internship at Apple with <a href="https://aravind-pg.github.io/" target="_blank">Aravind Gollakota</a> and <a href="https://preetum.nakkiran.org/" target="_blank">Preetum Nakkiran</a>.
      </li>
      <li>
        Fall 2024: Visitor at the Simons institute <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/modern-paradigms-generalization" target="_blank">modern paradigms in generalization</a> research program.
      </li>
      <li>
        Summer 2024: Research internship at Amazon with <a href="https://gaurush.com/" target="_blank">Gaurush Hiranandani</a>.
      </li>
    </ul>
      </p>
<!--   During Fall 2024, I was a visitor at the Simons institute <a href="https://simons.berkeley.edu/programs/modern-paradigms-generalization" target="_blank">modern paradigms in generalization</a> research program, where I ate a lot of good food and made many great friends. -->
<!--   Prior to that, I was lucky to intern withat Amazon during Summer 2024, working on black-box metric optimization for vision and language models.  -->

<p>I completed my undergraduate degrees in math and CS at <a href="https://utdallas.edu" target="_blank">The University of Texas at Dallas</a> (UTD), where I explored research in networking, theory, optimization, and reinforcement learning.
Along the way, I was extremely fortunate to be advised by these amazing professors, who greatly shaped the way I think about problems: 
<a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~nicholas.ruozzi/" target="_blank">Nick Ruozzi</a>, 
<a href="https://personal.utdallas.edu/~jjue/" target="_blank">Jason Jue</a>,

              <h4>Uncertainty Quantification and Calibration</h4>
              <p class="topic-description">Machine-learned models and systems which "know what they don't know" is a critical requirement of trustworthy AI. How should we measure and quantify such model uncertainty in practice? How does the problem change when models are deployed in the wild, especially in settings with diverse and non-homogenous populations? Finally, what does uncertainty quantification mean for large language models, and how is it impacted by reasoning post-training?</p>

              <p class="topic-description">Modern algorithmic platforms like LinkedIn, ride-sharing, or content delivery are increasingly complex aggregations of multiple machine-learned systems. How can we ensure that these "composite" systems are trustworthy, fair, and reliable? How does the problem change when pieces of these systems have intrinsic uncertainty tied to their predictions? Furthermore, how do we evaluate the fairness of production-grade systems in the wild?</p>

<h3 id="student-activities-and-service">Student Activities</h3>

<p>The first year of my PhD, I served as a CS department senator within the USC Viterbi Graduate Student Association (<a href="https://vgsa.usc.edu/" target="_blank">VGSA</a>), where I was able to
<a href="./assets/img/goats.jpg" target="_blank">bring goats to campus</a> (amongst other things).</p>

<p>I served as President / VP for my undergrad’s ACM chapter, where I am most proud to have established a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QSew9VcIULVYApC-Y8XFksglrRW7xyFd/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">
perpetual $30k endowed scholarship</a> with club funds. Importantly, the scholarship may also grant eligible students an in-state tuition waiver! Students can apply <a href="https://engineering.utdallas.edu/engineering/academics/undergraduate-majors/scholarships/" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I also served as the undergrad representative on the UTD CS department head search committee during the 2020-2021 academic year.</p>

<p>If you are a UTD student interested in pursuing a PhD, you may find the grad school section I wrote of <a href="https://github.com/acmutd/help-guide/wiki" target="_blank">this guide</a> helpful.
Also check out <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1MtKm6AFkHxh_niUaN6fdUnaNoyQCIRk1VM3qvpcD6ds/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">this research internship / REU masterlist</a> which I put together.</p>

<h3 id="fun">Fun</h3>
<p>In my free time I enjoy climbing/bouldering, surfing, hiking, and skiing (the latter two less frequently!). 
   I have (at some point in the past) also attempted the following: <a href="./art" target="_blank">learning art</a>, running, calisthenics progressions, playing classical piano, swimming, and binging npr tiny desk concerts.</p>

<p>Some other stuff from undergrad:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="./assets/files/Grad_Descent_in_Hyperbolic_Space.pdf" target="_blank">Clustering in hyperbolic space</a> (with <a href="https://starling.utdallas.edu/people/#michael-skinner-md" target="_blank">Mike Skinner</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="./assets/files/DRP_Notes.pdf" target="_blank">Short notes on statistical learning</a> (with <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=1mPmZIkAAAAJ&amp;hl=en" target="_blank">Dipnil Chakraborty</a>)</li>
  <li><a href="./assets/files/Problem_Solving_Presentation.pdf" target="_blank">Point packing in hypercubes</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://github.com/sid-devic/RuTroll" target="_blank">Coarse classification of russian troll tweets</a></li>
</ul>

<a href="rejections.html">Here</a> is a list of some of my rejections (e.g. jobs, fellowships, etc.) to help normalize the fact that most things don't work out :D
